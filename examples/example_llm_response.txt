Extension Questions for Advanced Learners

Solve the equation 2x + 3 = 15.
Solve the equation x - 2 = 7.
Solve the equation 3x + 4 = 18.
Detailed Solutions with Teaching Points

To solve the equation 2x + 3 = 15, we need to isolate the variable x.
First, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x + 3 - 3 = 15 - 3.
This simplifies to: 2x = 12.
Next, divide both sides of the equation by 2: 2x / 2 = 12 / 2.
This simplifies to: x = 6.
Therefore, the solution to the equation 2x + 3 = 15 is x = 6.
